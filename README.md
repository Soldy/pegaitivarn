# WIT ?

Pegaitivarn is a minimalistic AI helper and tester toolkit. 
The main goal is to help to write AI tools as fast as possible. This includes sensors, some file formats, games, and situation supports. 
Not just serve the purpose of helper. Sometimes, it serves as a simplification. Sometimes standardisation and simplifications. K.I.S.S.


# Elements

## Buffers

Buffers hold some information before providing or changing or both. Like simple serial number generators, not UUID type uid generators, or config (env, config file)helper. 


## File

Simple file support. Manage them as unsafe file processors. Do not let them process a file from an unknown source.


## Hwmon



## Text

Simple text processor tools. It's not a regular expectation like text/string modifiers. I use this because I can process a couple of terabytes of data faster. (In my case the data processing is 60 minutes with regular expectation that it take days.)
