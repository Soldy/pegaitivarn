Pegaitivarn is a minimalistic AI helper and tester toolkit.
The main goal is to help write AI tools and agents as fast as possible.
This includes sensors, some file formats, games, and situation supports.
Not just serve the purpose of helper. Sometimes, it serves as a simplification.

# Elements

## Buffers

Buffers hold some information before providing or changing or both. Like simple serial number generators, not UUID type uid generators, or config (env, config file)helper. 
Some buffer data is utilized for analysis purposes, including support for XML and HTML formats.

## File

Simple file support. Manage them as unsafe file processors. Do not let them process a file from an unknown source.


## Hwmon



## Text

Simple text processor tools. It's not a regular expectation like text/string modifiers. I use this because I can process a couple of terabytes of data faster. (In my case the data processing is 60 minutes with regular expectation that it take days.)
